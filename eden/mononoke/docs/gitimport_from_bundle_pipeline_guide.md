# Gitimport from Bundle Pipeline — User Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to use the Skycastle-based **gitimport-from-bundle** pipeline to import a Git repository into Mononoke from a Git bundle stored in Manifold. The pipeline automates:

1. Creating the repo in Mononoke (if it doesn't exist)
2. Cloning the repo from Mononoke
3. Downloading the Git bundle from Manifold
4. Unbundling and running gitimport
5. Forcing a Git server cache refresh
6. Verifying that all refs match between the bundle and Mononoke

All interaction is through the terminal/CLI.

---

## Prerequisites

You need the following on your Fedora machine (connected to Corp VPN):

1. **fbsource checkout** — An up-to-date checkout of the fbsource repository.

   ```bash
   # If you don't have one, follow the standard devserver setup.
   # If you already have one, pull the latest:
   cd ~/fbsource
   sl pull && sl goto master
   ```

2. **Manifold CLI** — Used to upload bundles to Manifold.

   ```bash
   # Install if not already available
   sudo dnf install fb-manifold
   ```

   Verify it works:

   ```bash
   manifold --help
   ```

3. **Skycastle CLI** — Comes with `arc`. Verify:

   ```bash
   arc skycastle --help
   ```

4. **VPN connection** — You must be connected to the Corp VPN for all commands to work.

## Step 1: Prepare the Git Bundle

If you already have a `.bundle` or `.pack` file, skip to Step 2.

To create a bundle from an existing Git repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/git/repo

# Create a bundle containing all refs
git bundle create /tmp/my_repo.bundle --all

# Verify the bundle is valid
git bundle verify /tmp/my_repo.bundle
```

---

## Step 2: Upload the Git Bundle to Manifold

Upload the bundle file to a Manifold bucket so the pipeline can fetch it.

```bash
manifold --apikey <YOUR_API_KEY> put <BUCKET_NAME>/<KEY_PATH> /tmp/my_repo.bundle
```

**Example:**

```bash
manifold --apikey upstream_repo_bundles-key put upstream_repo_bundles/flat/my_project_repo /tmp/my_repo.bundle
```

**Verify the upload succeeded:**

```bash
manifold --apikey upstream_repo_bundles-key ls upstream_repo_bundles/flat/my_project_repo
```

You should see the file listed with its size.

**Parameters explained:**
- `<YOUR_API_KEY>` — The Manifold API key for the bucket (e.g., `upstream_repo_bundles-key`). Ask your team if you don't know it.
- `<BUCKET_NAME>` — The Manifold bucket name (e.g., `upstream_repo_bundles`).
- `<KEY_PATH>` — The path/key within the bucket where the bundle will be stored (e.g., `flat/my_project_repo`).

---

## Step 3: Trigger the Skycastle Pipeline

Navigate to your fbsource checkout and run:

```bash
cd ~/fbsource

arc skycastle schedule \
  //tools/skycastle/workflows2/mononoke/mononoke_gitimport_from_bundle.sky:gitimport_from_bundle \
  --flag repo_name="<REPO_NAME>" \
  --flag manifold_key="<KEY_PATH>"
```

### Required Inputs

| Flag | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `repo_name` | The Mononoke repo name. Use `<namespace>/<repo>` format. | `aosp/platform_build` |
| `manifold_key` | The key/path of the bundle within the bucket. | `flat/platform_build` |

### Optional Inputs

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `manifold_bucket` | `upstream_repo_bundles` | The Manifold bucket where the bundle is stored. |
| `manifold_apikey` | `upstream_repo_bundles-key` | API key for Manifold access. |
| `oncall_name` | `rl_source_control` | Oncall team name used during repo creation. |
| `include_refs` | `""` (all refs) | Comma-separated list of refs to import. Leave empty to import all. |
| `hipster_group` | `""` | Hipster group for ACL setup during repo creation. |
| `gitimport_concurrency` | `200` | Number of concurrent gitimport operations. |

### Minimal Example

```bash
arc skycastle schedule \
  //tools/skycastle/workflows2/mononoke/mononoke_gitimport_from_bundle.sky:gitimport_from_bundle \
  --flag repo_name="aosp/platform_build" \
  --flag manifold_key="flat/platform_build"
```

### Full Example (with all flags explicit)

```bash
arc skycastle schedule \
  //tools/skycastle/workflows2/mononoke/mononoke_gitimport_from_bundle.sky:gitimport_from_bundle \
  --flag repo_name="aosp/platform_build" \
  --flag manifold_bucket="upstream_repo_bundles" \
  --flag manifold_key="flat/platform_build" \
  --flag manifold_apikey="upstream_repo_bundles-key" \
  --flag oncall_name="rl_source_control"
```

### Successful Output

On success, you will see output like:

```text
Success!
    Duration: 10 secs
    Invocation ID: BnlKsfoe
    Workflow run ID: 3422735716815416755
    Workflow run URL: https://www.internalfb.com/sandcastle/workflow/3422735716815416755
    Execution Job(s): https://www.internalfb.com/intern/sandcastle/job/58546795361304427/
```

**Save the Workflow run URL** — you will need it to check the status.

---

## Step 4: Check Pipeline Status

### Option A: Via CLI

```bash
# Check the status of a workflow run by ID
arc skycastle status <WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>
```

Example:

```bash
arc skycastle status 3422735716815416755
```

### Option B: Via Browser

Open the **Workflow run URL** from the scheduling output in your browser:

```text
https://www.internalfb.com/sandcastle/workflow/<WORKFLOW_RUN_ID>
```

This shows all 6 pipeline steps with their status (pending, running, passed, failed). Click on any step to see its logs.

### Option C: Via Execution Job URL

Open the **Execution Job URL** from the scheduling output:

```text
https://www.internalfb.com/intern/sandcastle/job/<JOB_ID>/
```

This provides detailed logs for each action in the pipeline.

## Pipeline Steps Explained

The pipeline runs 6 sequential steps:

| Step | Name | What It Does |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Check or Create Repo** | Checks if the repo exists in Mononoke. If not, creates it via SCS thrift and polls for up to 45 minutes for the creation to complete. |
| 2 | **Clone from Mononoke** | Clones the repo from Mononoke's Git server. If the repo is empty (newly created), initializes a bare repo instead. |
| 3 | **Fetch Bundle** | Downloads the Git bundle from Manifold to the worker machine. |
| 4 | **Unbundle and Gitimport** | Unpacks the bundle into the cloned repo and runs `gitimport` to import all objects and refs into Mononoke. Retries up to 45 times with 60-second intervals if gitimport fails (e.g., waiting for config propagation). |
| 5 | **Bust Git Cache** | Pushes and deletes a temporary branch to force the Mononoke Git server to refresh its cache. |
| 6 | **Verify Import** | Compares refs from the bundle with refs on the Mononoke Git server to confirm everything was imported correctly. |

## Troubleshooting

### Repo creation uses wrong oncall

By default, repo creation uses the `rl_source_control` oncall. If you need a different oncall, override it with `--flag oncall_name="<your_oncall>"`.

### Repo creation timed out

The pipeline polls for up to 45 minutes for the repo creation mutation to land. If it times out:
- Check if the SCS service is healthy.
- Check the Sandcastle job logs for the `create_repos_poll` responses to see the status codes.
- Retry the pipeline — if the repo was partially created, subsequent runs will detect it.

### Gitimport fails after all retries

Gitimport retries up to 45 times with 60-second intervals (total ~45 minutes). Common causes:
- **Config not propagated**: New repos need their config to propagate. The retry mechanism handles this, but if 45 minutes isn't enough, check config propagation manually.
- **Large repo**: For very large repos, increase concurrency with `--flag gitimport_concurrency=400` or adjust as needed.
- Check the detailed logs in Sandcastle for the specific error message.

### Verification failed: refs do not match

The final step compares bundle refs with Mononoke Git server refs. If they don't match:
- **Extra refs in Mononoke**: The repo may have had pre-existing refs. This is usually fine.
- **Missing refs in Mononoke**: Gitimport may have skipped some refs. Check the gitimport logs for errors.
- **Cache not fully refreshed**: The cache-busting step may not have fully propagated. Wait a few minutes and manually check with:

  ```bash
  git ls-remote https://git.internal.tfbnw.net/repos/git/ro/<REPO_NAME>.git
  ```

### Manifold upload/download failures

- Verify your API key is correct: `manifold --apikey <KEY> ls <BUCKET>/<PATH>`
- Ensure the bundle file is not corrupted: `git bundle verify /path/to/bundle`
- Check that the Manifold bucket exists and you have write access.

### Clone fails during Step 2

- For newly created repos, clone failure is expected and handled automatically (the pipeline initializes a bare repo instead).
- If clone fails for an existing repo, check network connectivity to `git.internal.tfbnw.net`.

### "arc skycastle" command not found

Ensure `arc` is installed and in your PATH:

```bash
# On Fedora, install arc tools
sudo dnf install fb-arcanist
```

### VPN connectivity issues

All commands require Corp VPN. Verify connectivity:

```bash
# Test access to internal services
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://git.internal.tfbnw.net
```

If you get connection errors, reconnect your VPN and retry.

### Pipeline infra failures and retries

The pipeline is configured with 3 automatic infra-level retries. If a failure is due to infrastructure issues (machine problems, network blips), it will automatically retry the entire workflow. User failures (bad input, missing permissions) will not be retried.
