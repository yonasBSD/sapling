    Create a synchronous Thrift client for communicating with the Eden Thrift server.

    blocked IPC channel surfaces as a fast TransportError instead of an
    indefinite hang.

    Args:
        eden_dir: Path to the Eden mount directory. Used to derive the socket
            path if socket_path is not provided.
        socket_path: Socket path to connect to the Eden server directly.
        timeout: Default per-RPC timeout in seconds. Each RPC call will time

            timeout.
        socket_init_timeout: Timeout in seconds for the initial socket connection.
            Defaults to 120s for parity with the Rust EdenFS client at
